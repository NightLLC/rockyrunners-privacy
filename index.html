  <h1>RockyRunners Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25/02/26</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how RockyRunners ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects user information when you use the RockyRunners application and related services.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    RockyRunners does not collect personal identifying information such as names, addresses, or payment details. The application may process limited technical data required for core functionality, including device type and system performance information.
  </p>

  <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
  <p>
    RockyRunners may request access to the device microphone solely to enable in-game features such as voice interaction or communication. Audio input is processed in real time and is not recorded, stored, or transmitted to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Any data processed by the application is used strictly to operate and improve the app experience. We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    RockyRunners is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights under applicable privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA, including the right to request access to or deletion of your data. Since RockyRunners does not store personal data, such requests generally do not apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    RockyRunners does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
